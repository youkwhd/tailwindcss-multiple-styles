tailwindcss-multiple-styles
===========================

Concept library that adds multiple styles / classes support for
tailwindcss.

ATTENTION: since tailwind doesn't support dynamic styles,
please see:
https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#safelisting-classes

Examples
--------

.. code:: typescript

    import { t } from "tailwindcss-multiple-styles"

    <div className={t`bg-blue-500 hover:(text-white text-xl)`}>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>

Sadly, you can't do this since tailwindcss does not support
dynamic styles.

However, you can work around this by specifying styles that
would be added within the `hover:` state in the tailwind config
file. But, as much as i like it, it is not a good practice.


Future Support
--------------

It *could* be possible to add dynamic styles in the tailwind
config.
